# Code Test

Simple java code test for a mock interview.

git clone <this repo>

implement the stubbed out methods.

mvn test

You're done when all the tests pass. In reality, you won't have time to do all the problems. That's ok.

# Camel Case Problem

Turn a sentence into a camel case string:

input -> "For example, this sentence would be turned into something else."

output -> "forExampleThisSentenceWouldBeTurnedIntoSomethingElse"

# Fibonacci

write a function that returns the Fibonacci number of a given int.

# Longest Palindrome

Given a string, find the longest palindrome in it.

# Poker

This is more open-ended to see how you work through a problem. You have a Card object (I put the available suits and ranks in there... good idea?) There's a Deck object that doesn't do a whole lot of anything.

1) Talk about how would you implement a 5 card Poker game using this as a starting point.

2) Can you write a public static void main(String[] args) inside com.fiftytwo.cards.Poker that deals 3 unique poker hands from a deck of cards? Run it using "mvn exec:java"
